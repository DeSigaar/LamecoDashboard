## About

This project was made by some students from the [Fontys Hogeschool ICT](https://fontys.nl/hbo-ict/) on behalf of [Laméco](https://www.lameco.nl/).  
A live preview can be found on our [deployed heroku app](https://lameco-dashboard.herokuapp.com/).

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js installed. If you are unsure if node is installed, run `$ node -v` within terminal/command prompt.

### Clone

Clone this repository to your local machine and move to the new folder.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/MaxAltena/LamecoDashboard.git
$ cd LamecoDashboard
```

### Setup

Install all needed node modules for both frontend and backend.

```
$ npm run install-all
```

### Running

For the application to be able to function as normal, it needs to run both the frontend and backend.

```
$ npm run dev
```

This starts the backend on port 5000 and the frontend on port 3000 concurrently.

## API documentation

The API documentation for the API used within the application can be found in our [Postman collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5448152/RWgxtZy1).
